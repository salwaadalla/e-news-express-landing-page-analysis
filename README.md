# E-news Express

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of a new landing page for the E-news Express portal in attracting new subscribers. The executives at E-news Express believe that there has been a decline in new monthly subscribers compared to the past year and suspect that the webpage needs to be updated in terms of outline and content to meet customer preferences.

## Data Collection
To achieve the objectives, 100 users were randomly selected and divided equally into two groups. The first group was shown the existing landing page, while the second group was shown the new landing page. Interactions of both groups were collected for analysis.

## Analysis
The collected data was explored and analyzed to answer the following questions:
- Do users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?
- Is the conversion rate for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
- Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
- Is the time spent on the new page the same for different language users?

## Conclusion
Key findings from the analysis include:
- The new landing page attracts more user engagement, with statistically significant evidence showing higher average time spent compared to the old page.
- The conversion rate for the new page is significantly higher than that of the old page, indicating its effectiveness in attracting new subscribers.
- Language preference does not significantly influence conversion rates.
- Time spent on the new page does not vary significantly across different language users.

Based on these findings, it is recommended that E-news Express should utilize the new landing page to attract more subscribers and focus on updating the outline and content of their portal to meet customer preferences.
